## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! My name is Brandon. I was born in May 2002 and I am currently a junior at NYU with an aspiration to be a software engineer. I have lived in NYC all of my life but I am always looking to broaden my horizons in life. Undoubtably, technology and programming has grown to be a large part of my life. Coding has become my way of connecting people and making the world a better place with the applications I create. Software engineering can improve and enrich lives in many different sectors from business to health to entertainment and I want to be at the center of it. I want to learn about cool technology, meet even cooler people, and chase after my ambitions.

I am currently looking to get more experience as a software engineer, mostly likely through an internship, so I can meet new people and experience new things. Other than that, I am also curently working on a Hobby sharing blog which I have deployed on AWS. It was built using React.js and Express.js. I plan to greatly expand this project and add unit testing with Jest and Mocha as well as CI/CD. Socket.IO will be added in the future along with various post input types. I am also working on improving the UI/UX as well as authentication security. Overall, there is a lot I want to do.
